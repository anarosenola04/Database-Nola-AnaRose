# Database Documentation

The database

This databaseis made to manage the data needed for an Educational Blog site. It is consist of five (5) tables which are students, borrows, books, authors and types of book. In this database I decided that this was the database I would make because I knew it would used in school. In this database, here you will find out who goes to the library and who does not. In this database only admin can login to monitor students. Because in my experience at the Assupmtion, students first need to borrow books before the librarian sign the clearance. And this is good example for students to get used reading books and not just based on the internet. This system is operated in a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) called MySQL using the PhpMyAdmin platform.
